# eq_control

Eq control is an esp32/arduino based equatorial telescop mount controler system.

This system was originally designed for EQ3, but has been sucessfully used on EQ5 and other az mounts.

It consist of a CPU that can control 3 stepper motors for RA, Dec and focus, a LCD and a keyboard.

It can be used "in hand" as an offline controler.
Or connected to a computer with Ascom for more complex astro (like astro photography).
The controler is a 6*7*1.7cm box which does everything!


This project started on arduino Nano. This was never released to the "public", but I have given a number of boards to various persons and I still own a number of them.
I have arduino and esp32 based boards and since I do not want to "loose" my old boards, I will need to continue to support them.
Hence the code here supports both versions aven 

The first oficially released version is the "latest" version for arduino. As
